In the passive voice,\\n \\nemphasis is put on the effect of an action rather than on the doer.\\n\\nThe letter will be sent tomorrow.\\n\\nThe work will be done on time.\\n\\nFirst, let\\u2019s refresh the Future Simple structure with the Active Voice:\\n\\n[subject] + will + verb without \\u2018to\\u2019\\n\\nTo make statements with the Future Simple Passive, use:\\n\\n[subject] + will be + the Past Participle form of the verb\\n\\nFuture Simple Passive forms are normally built using \\u2018will\\u2019 rather than \\u2018going to\\u2019:\\n\\nThe motorway will be closed for three days.\\n\\nYour room will be cleaned while you are out.\\n\\nOnly English will be spoken at the conference.\\n\\nI will be treated\\n\\nYou will be treated\\n\\nThe new university will be opened by the President.\\n\\nThe contract will be signed tomorrow.\\n\\nThe documents will all be signed by next week.\\n\\nWe use Future Simple Passive for actions or events that will happen\\n\\nin future (tomorrow, next week (month, year), in 2020).\\n\\nUnlike the Future Perfect Passive, there\\u2019s no deadline here.\\n\\nIn such statements we focus attention on the person or thing\\n\\naffected by the action, when the subject is unknown, unclear or irrelevant.\\n\\n\",R20:\"\\n<h3>Present perfect passive construction</h3>\\n\\nPresent perfect passive construction: has/have + been + past participle\\n \\nExample verb: visit\\n\\nI have been visited  \\n\\nWe have been visited\\n\\nYou have been visited \\n \\nYou (guys) have been visited\\n\\nHe/she/it has been visited  \\n\\nThey have been visited\\n\\nThe agent is unknown.

It always refers to past time:\\n\\nWe used to go to the seaside every summer when I was a kid.\\n\\nNot: We are used to go \\u2026 or We use to go \\u2026 or We were used to go \\u2026\\n\\n<h4>Negative: didn\\u2019t use to</h4>\\n\\nThe negative of used to is most commonly didn\\u2019t use(d) to.\\n\\nSometimes we write it with a final -d, sometimes not.\\n\\nBoth forms are common, but many people consider the form\\n \\nwith the final -d to be incorrect, and you should not use it in exams:\\n\\nIt didn\\u2019t use to be so crowded in the shops as it is nowadays.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t used to like broccoli when I was younger, but I love it\\n\\nnow. (Don\\u2019t use this form in exams.)\\n\\nIn very formal styles, we can use the negative form used not to:\\n\\nShe used not to live as poorly as she does now.\\n\\n<h4>Questions</h4>\\n\\nThe most common form of question is auxiliary did + use(d) to.\\n \\nMany people consider the form with a final -d to be incorrect,\\n \\nand you should not use it in exams:\\n\\nI think we met once, a couple of years ago.\\n\\nDid you use to work with Kevin Harris?\\n\\nDidn\\u2019t she used to live in the same street as us?\\n\\n(Don\\u2019t use this form in written exams.)\\n\\n\",R23:\"\\n<h3>If sentences (conditional sentences)</h3>\\n\\nSentences containing the word if are called conditional\\n\\nsentences because they usually express a condition.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nIf he comes, ask him to wait.\\n\\nIf it rains, we will get wet.\\n\\nIf you study hard, you will pass your exam.\\n\\nThere are four types of if sentences in English.\\n\\nThe zero conditional\\n\\nThe type 1 conditional\\n\\nThe type 2 conditional\\n\\nThe type 3 conditional\\n\\n<h4>The zero conditional</h4>\\n\\nIn a zero conditional sentence, we use a present\\n\\ntense in both parts of the sentence.\\n\\nIf you give respect, you get respect.\\n\\nIf you heat ice, it melts.\\n\\nThe type zero conditional sentences are used\\n\\nto talk about real and possible situations.\\n\\n<h4>Type 1 conditional</h4>\\n\\nType 1 conditional sentences are used to talk about\\n \\npossible situations and their probable results.\\n\\nIn these sentences we use the simple present\\n\\nin the if clause and the simple future in the result clause.\\n\\nIf you work hard, you will succeed.\\n\\nIf you ask him, he will help you.\\n\\nIf you invite them, they will come.\\n\\n<h4>Type 2 conditional</h4>\\n\\nThese sentences are used to talk about an unlikely condition\\n \\nand its probable result. Here the tense in the if clause is\\n\\nthe simple past and the tense in the main clause is\\n\\n the present conditional (would + get).\\n\\nIf you asked him, he would help you.\\n\\nIf you studied hard you would pass your exam.\\n\\nIf you invited them, they would come.\\n\\n<h4>Type 3 conditional</h4>\\n\\nIn a type 3 conditional sentence, the tense in the if clause\\n\\nis the past perfect and the tense in the main clause\\n\\nis the perfect conditional (would have + infinitive).\\n\\nIf you had invited them, they would have come.\\n\\nIf you had asked him, he would have helped you.\\n\\n\",R24:\"\\n<h3>Gerund</h3>\\nA verbal noun in Latin that expresses generalized or\\n\\nuncompleted action. \\nAny of several linguistic forms analogous to the Latin gerund\\n\\nin languages other than Latin\\n\\nEspecially : the English verbal noun ending in -ing that has\\n\\nthe function of a substantive and at the same time shows the verbal\\n \\nfeatures of tense, voice, and capacity to take adverbial qualifiers\\n \\nand to govern (see GOVERN sense 4) objects\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nLearning can be fun\\n\\nI like building things\\n\\nWhen it comes to hunting deer, nobody is better than Leroy.\\n\\n\",R25:\"\\n<h3>Adverb</h3>\\nAn adverb is a word that modifies (describes) a verb\\n\\n(he sings loudly), an adjective (very tall), another adverb\\n\\n(ended too quickly), or even a whole sentence\\n\\n(Fortunately, I had brought an umbrella).\\n\\nAdverbs often end in -ly, but some (such as fast)\\n\\nlook exactly the same as their adjective counterparts.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nTom Longboat did not run badly.\\n\\nTom is very tall.\\n\\nThe race finished too quickly.\\n\\nFortunately, Lucy recorded Tom's win.\\n\\n\",R26:\"\\n<h3>Punctuation</h3>\\nThe most common punctuation marks in English are:\\n \\ncapital letters and full stops, question marks, commas,\\n \\ncolons and semi-colons, exclamation marks and quotation marks.\\n\\nIn speaking, we use pauses and the pitch of the voice to make\\n \\nwhat we say clear.
